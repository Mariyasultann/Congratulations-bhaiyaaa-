      Congratulations,Bhudao, on your graduation.
I wanted to write this letter a long time ago, but I didn’t have the courage. So here it begins.

You have always supported me since we were kids, and you’ve always made me feel special. I’m really thankful to have you as my brother. And I’m truly proud that you’ve graduated. Getting a degree is a big achievement — but more than that, I want to say that you’ve always been a great brother.

You’ve always been kind and funny.
When we were small, we only used to fight, so I didn’t realise back then how much you meant to me. Now that we’ve grown up and live in different places, we don’t get chances to fight, and honestly, I sometimes feel scared to talk much.

But I want to build a strong bond with you ,one where I can tell you everything without thinking twice.
And I also want you to know that whenever you feel low or just feel like talking, remember you have a little sister who is always there for you — someone you can count on.

Arham Bhaiya, I’m thankful for so many things  but I can’t always say them out loud.
Whenever I cried, you would always make a joke and cheer me up. You never let me stay sad for long.
No one can tease me too much  because I have you.

Now that we’re both becoming adults, I really want our bond to grow into a friendship  like best friends.
